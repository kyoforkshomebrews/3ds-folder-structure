# 3ds-folder-structure
What the 3ds homebrew folder structure could look like, inspired by wiiu one.

Right now my 3DS SD Card is a mess. I want to fix that by forking and changing some paths.

# What do the files in this repository stand for?
All the files in the 3ds folder stand for folders.

apps - that's where .3dsx, .elf and other 3ds homebrew should go

backups - for saves backups with checkpoint or similar apps

data - for configs, saves (of homebrew apps/games) etc. (kinda like %AppData% in Windows)

games - i don't know, put your game cias there? or maybe... games for emulators and the like..

plugins - for plugins for example for ntr cfw.

plugins/ntr/ - only ntr plugins

plugins/luma/ - only luma plugins

plugins/CTRPF/ - only CTRPF plugins

(etc)

screenshots - for screenshots. could have subfolder for different programs (ntr and luma both can make screenshots for example) could also have a merged folder.

saves - for save editors maybe

Note that this is a recommendation and i dont want to say "hey everyone use this, and exactly like this!" i just want to make my sd card tidier and maybe ones of other people too. Feel free to suggest changes in the issues.
