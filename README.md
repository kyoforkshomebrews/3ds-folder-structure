# 3ds-folder-structure
What the 3ds homebrew folder structure could look like, inspired by wiiu one.

Right now my 3DS SD Card is a mess. I want to fix that by forking and changing some paths.

# What do the files in this repository stand for?
All the files in the 3ds folder stand for folders.

apps - that's where .3dsx, .elf and other 3ds homebrew should go
backups - for saves backups with checkpoint or similar apps
data - for configs, saves (of homebrew apps/games) etc. (kinda like %AppData% in Windows)
plugins - for plugins for example for ntr cfw.
plugins/ntr/ - only ntr plugins
plugins/luma/ - only luma plugins
plugins/CTRPF/ - only CTRPF plugins
(etc)
screenshots - for screenshots. could have subfolder for different programs (ntr and luma both can make screenshots for example) could also have a merged folder.
